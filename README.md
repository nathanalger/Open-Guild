# Open Guild (OG)
Open Guild is a guild-based chatroom application designed for gamers. Servers are easy, scalable, and easy to host and simple to setup. Members can chat among friends and play games.

# Server Hosting
Servers (guilds) are hosted individually and privacy is a priority. Backend software is designed to scale to the host machine so that servers can fit your needs. 

# Open Source
This project is designed to be open source so that the original vision of privacy and scalability is not lost. I welcome any contributions made, any progress is good progress.
