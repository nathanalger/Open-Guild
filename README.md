# Open Guild

Open Guild is a next-generation, Discord-inspired community platform that empowers users to host their own servers—either locally on their own machines or in the cloud. Our mission is to give communities full control, privacy, and flexibility, with both free and paid hosting options.

## Features

- **Self-Hosted Servers:**  
  Users can easily spin up and manage their own servers on their own hardware with a simple launcher and a little port forwarding.

- **Cloud Hosting:**  
  For those who prefer a simpler, more managed experience, Open Guild offers free and paid cloud hosting tiers.

- **Server Discovery:**  
  Find and join public servers hosted by the community.

- **Discord-Like Experience:**  
  Channels, roles, permissions, moderation tools, and bot/plugin support.

- **Open Source:**  
  All code is open and contributions are welcome!
